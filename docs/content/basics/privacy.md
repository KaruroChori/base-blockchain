Privacy is an opt-in feature in NAME. You are in control of how much information you want to make public about your transactions, which means that as long as the worker does not leak your requests, the actual content you asked for can hidden.  
However it should be pointed out that doing so also means that consensus processes on your transactions, as well as the ability of withnesses to mark irregular behaviour will be decreased or even fully ineffective.

For this reason, privacy is not suggested as you are more likely going to be a target for bad workers, but it can be used in the context of a private or trusted shard operating in the network (like submitting tasks to your own or your friends workers).
